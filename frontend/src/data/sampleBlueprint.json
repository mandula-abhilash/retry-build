  "description": "Software that reduces noise for nursing teams. Helps staff focus, lowers stress, and gives managers live noise insights.",
  "problem_statement": "Hospital floors are loud: alarms, carts, conversations, and machines. Constant noise raises stress and error risk for nurses. It also hurts sleep and long-term health. Hospitals lack simple tools to measure, manage, and act on noise in real time. This gap lowers job satisfaction and can push staff to leave.",
  "solution_overview": "Build a web and mobile app that filters non-critical sounds in headsets and flags excessive noise on the floor. The system monitors noise by zone, classifies sources, and sends alerts only when thresholds matter. Managers get dashboards, trends, and root-cause hints to fix noisy routines. The app syncs with existing comms so critical alarms always break through.",
  "target_users": "Primary buyers are hospital and clinic operations leaders who manage nursing units. Daily users are nurses on shift who need fewer distractions. Secondary users include charge nurses, facility managers, and patient experience teams.",
